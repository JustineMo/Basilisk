Designed by **Justė Motuzaitė**.

Main questions to be answered below.

**1. Why modular vertical garden?**

Vertical gardening is a type of space-effective gardening, used for small spaces, because plants are grown vertically. This is a way to fit your favourite seasonings, herbs or decorative plants into one place near the window. 

Modular structure. Because of identical profile, plant pot holders can be stacked on top of each other, making Basilisk highly adaptible to each user's needs. Size can vary from as little as 2 plants to 10-13 plants per Garden. And if there is a wish for an upgrade, all you need to do is 3D print one more pot holder!

> Short answer: Space-effectiveness + high adaptability.

**2. What is hidroponics?**

It is a plant growing method, where instead of soil, different (porous) substrate is used, such as expanded clay pebbles. Most of the time, irrigation system is circular, which can help reduce water usage as mush as 70%. Soilless structure is significantly lighter as well.

**3. What is the level of complexity of this project?**

Levels may vary according to your dedication and knowledge. 

 1. level: Only by 3D printing the structure, installing a pump and an electrical socket timer you can already have an autonomous watering system to water your plants in constant periods of time. 
 2.  level: Involves arduino programing and electronics. There are two main sensors: soil moisture sensor and water level sensor. With these components you can have a smarter autonomous system which only waters when necessary and can notify you, when water level in the water tank is getting low. This is the level the first prototype development.
 3. level: Smartness of Basilisk can be increased by adding different sensors to help measure ambient light, temperature and many more. Adding LEDs would enable Basilisk to have artificial light, so your plants could get as much light as they need!
 
 **4. What is the current stage of this project?**
 
The product is being developed.
Current stage: prototyping.


Current tasks: 
- Electronic components. Testing and waterproofing individual sensors, minor fixes. 
- Programing Arduino.
- Work on physical structure. Minor part development, optimization, some structure fixes.

Assembled Basilisk construction with 5 places for plants.
